This is the preferred approach.\nUpload the binary image data without the metadata.\nWhile all photos appearing on the Picasa Web Albums site are in the JPEG format, photos of any of the following types can be uploaded using the API:\n- image/bmp\n- image/gif\n- image/jpeg\n- image/png\n\nA video is posted in the same way as a photo with metadata (Note: You cannot submit a video without metadata at this time, you must use a MIME multipart).
