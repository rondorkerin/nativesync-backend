If you wish to use your own developer credentials, use the other &ldquo;create session&rdquo; resource.]</b> All operations in the Getty Images Connect API require an authentication token argument provided in the RequestHeader. An authentication token securely identifies the caller of an operation. When called, an operation checks the validity of the provided authentication token before executing the request. A malformed, invalid, or expired token will cause an operation to fail. Clients get authentication tokens by authenticating themselves using the CreateSession operation. Some operations are designated secure only. This designation means that the operation: 1) must be called over an SSL connection 2) with a secure token. Secure authentication tokens are provided by the CreateSession operation. Secure tokens are essentially the same as standard tokens, with the difference that secure tokens can only be used over SSL connections. Calling any operation with a secure token over a non-SSL connection will result in an error. Tokens expire after 30 minutes. Clients can renew a token before it expires by using the RenewSession operation, without having to provide credentials again. <b>We recommend clients track each token&rsquo;s time-to-expiration, and proactively call RenewSession prior to the token's expiration.</b>",
